## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to create an Ecommerce Product Page showcasing different types of products, their prices, images in different angles, etc. Users should be able to view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size, see hover states for all interactive elements on the page, open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image, switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images, add items to the cart, view the cart, and remove items from it.
